ULMTCS-1#1 Warning
Control Sets use limits recommend reduction  
This design uses 671 control sets (vs. available limit of 8150, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 7.5 percent. This is at a level where reduction is RECOMMENDED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 180 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
